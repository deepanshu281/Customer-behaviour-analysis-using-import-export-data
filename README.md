I analyzed import-export data to understand consumer behavior, product demand, and preferences influenced by price changes. Key elements of the project included:

1. Data Collection and Cleaning: I gathered and cleaned a dataset of import/export records, focusing on products like Butyl Acetate and Ortho-Xylene.

2. Analysis: Using Python with libraries like Pandas and NumPy, I performed exploratory data analysis (EDA) and time-series analysis to identify demand trends in relation to price fluctuations.

3. Insights: I segmented the data by region and customer type to reveal varying demand patterns and calculated the price elasticity of demand to understand consumer sensitivity to price changes.

4. Visualization and Reporting: I created visualizations to highlight key findings, compiling them into a report that provided actionable recommendations for optimizing pricing strategies.
